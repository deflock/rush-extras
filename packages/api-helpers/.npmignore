# .npmignore files follow the same pattern rules as .gitignore files:
# - Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
# - Standard glob patterns work.
# - You can end patterns with a forward slash / to specify a directory.
# - You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point !
#
# Additionally, everything in node_modules is ignored, except for bundled dependencies. 
# npm automatically handles this for you, so don't bother adding node_modules to .npmignore.
#
# The following paths and files are never ignored, so adding them to .npmignore is pointless:
# - package.json
# - README (and its variants)
# - CHANGELOG (and its variants)
# - LICENSE / LICENCE
